# some simple Fischertechnik Apps
Hi!
I'm new to programming and just started out with Fischertechnik.

While I try out various things I will use this space to provide some simple apps written in python3. They're generally used together with fischertechnik controllers such as the ftTXT and ftrobopy python library for the fischertechnik community firmware (CFW).

The Fischertechnik CFW for controllers like ftTXT, TX-PI, etc. can be obtained here: https://github.com/ftCommunity/ftcommunity-TXT, 
and more Information on the CFW is available here: https://cfw.ftcommunity.de/ftcommunity-TXT/de/
If you want to control your ft Motors out of Python3 you will want to check out FTrobopy here: https://github.com/ftrobopy/ftrobopy
