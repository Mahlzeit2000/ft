# some simple Fischertechnik Apps
Hi!
I'm new to programming and just started out with Fischertechnik.
While I try out various things I will use this space to provide some simple Fischertechnik Apps for the ft CFW Firmware that I think could be useful for
other people.

The Fischertechnik CFW for controllers like ftTXT, TX-PI, etc. can be obtained here: https://github.com/ftCommunity/ftcommunity-TXT, 
and more Information on the CFW is available here https://cfw.ftcommunity.de/ftcommunity-TXT/de/
